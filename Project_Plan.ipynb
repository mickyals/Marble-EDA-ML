    "\n",
    "- COmplete Ryan's tutorials as examples of analysis of geoscience data\n",
    "- To build a full ML project in marble (variables -> thunderstorms)\n",
    "- recreate [climate report](https://data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/sr15_scenario_analysis/index.html) notebooks\n",

    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the test by Ryan Abernathey provides a great framework.\n",
    "   1. Make a copy of the text chapters optimised for Marble\n",
    "2. Once, optimised, begin a visual tutorial\n",
    "   1. Tutorial on retrieving data in Marble\n",
    "   2. Tutorial on EDA in Marble\n",
    "   3. Tutorial on feature engineering in Marble\n",
    "   4. Tutorial building and testing an ML solution in Marble\n",
    "3. Make changes to the book chapters based on learnings encountered during step 2\n",
    "4. Submit for review\n",
    "   1. Make changes as needed or requested\n",
    "   2. submit\n",
